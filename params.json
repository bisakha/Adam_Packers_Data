{"name":"Adam Packers data","tagline":"","body":"Adam_Packers_Data\r\n=================\r\n\r\nTo execute simpleProgrammaticslider_recon.m\r\n\r\n1.Please change line 2 to the path to your score files. GTE scores are available for conditioning levels {1,1.1,1.2} and bin edge = 0.15 for \r\nH115_z150_dfofOut and H116_z150_dfofOut. The former has 279 neurons and the latter has 334 neurons.\r\nThe number of time points is 5400.\r\n\r\n2.Please change line 6 to the path to your .mat file. (Eg: H116_z150_dfofOut.mat). These are raw traces \r\nwithout any baseline correction.\r\n\r\n3.The code for merging baseline corrected series from Jordi is in baseline_corrected.m\r\n\r\nThe code to generate the video from the images is in im2vid.m. Please change line 2 in im2vid.m to point to your folder of \r\nimages corresponding to 20130523_H116_T-003. You can download the images folder corresponding to\r\n20130523_H116_T-003 from here () .\r\nAll of this corresponds to the movieName 20130523_H116_T003_z150 found here ().\r\nThe README is here ().\r\nwhich describes the 'z_150' experimental conditions for time series 3. The neuron locations can be found in H116_z150_dfofOut(1).contours. Each cell describes the contours of the neurons. For my MATLAB figures, I just \r\nassumed a 'mean' position for each neuron, so that I could draw the arrows.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
